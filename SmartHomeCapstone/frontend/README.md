Smart Home Automation FrontendProject OverviewWelcome to the Smart Home Automation Frontend project! This application provides an intuitive and centralized web interface for monitoring, controlling, and managing smart devices within a home environment. Our goal is to simplify the smart home experience by consolidating various device controls and statuses into a single, user-friendly dashboard.The TeamJonee McKellar - Scrum Master / Project LeadDanielson Adjocy - Lead DeveloperTrintie Jackson - Lead DesignerToby Evans - Frontend Developer(Add more if applicable)Screenshot![Smart Home Dashboard Screenshot](Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 2.18.10â€¯PM.png)Description of the AppThis React.js single-page application serves as the primary user interface for interacting with a smart home system. It allows homeowners to:View a Dynamic Dashboard: Get a real-time overview of all registered smart devices, displaying their current status (e.g., temperature, ON/OFF state, battery level).Control Devices: Adjust settings for devices like smart thermostats (setting target temperatures) and smart lights (toggling power state) directly from the dashboard.Register New Devices: Easily add new smart devices to the home system, expanding the network's capabilities.The application communicates with a dedicated backend web service to retrieve and persist device data, ensuring all controls and statuses are up-to-date and reliably stored.Demo LinkExperience the live application here:https://your-project-name.vercel.app (Replace with your actual Vercel URL)Installation InstructionsTo get a local copy of this project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:PrerequisitesNode.js (LTS version recommended)npm (usually comes with Node.js) or YarnGitSetupClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepoName].git

Known IssuesExternal Registration Latency: Registering devices usinthg external services (Apple/Google sign-in) is noticeably slower than manual registration, and the UI currently lacks a visual loading indicator, potentially confusing the user.Roadmap FeaturesWe have exciting plans for future enhancements to elevate the smart home experience:User Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure login, registration, and user-specific device management.Third-Party API Integration: Incorporate external services like local weather forecasts, calendar integration, or voice assistant commands.Advanced Automations & Scenes: Allow users to create custom scenes (e.g., "Goodnight" to dim lights, lock doors) and set up conditional rules.Device History & Analytics: Display usage graphs for energy consumption, temperature trends, etc.Improved Device Categories: Enhance categorization and filtering of devices.Notifications: Implement real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., door unlocked, motion detected).CreditsBuilt with React.jsDeployment & CI/CD powered by Vercel
