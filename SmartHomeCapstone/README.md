# Smart Home Automation

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Home Automation** project! This application provides an intuitive and centralized web interface for monitoring, controlling, and managing smart devices within a home environment. Our goal is to simplify the smart home experience by consolidating various device controls and statuses into a single, user-friendly dashboard.

## Description of the App

This React single-page application serves as the primary user interface for interacting with a smart home system. It allows homeowners to:

* **View a Dynamic Dashboard:** Get a real-time overview of all registered smart devices, displaying their current status (e.g., temperature, ON/OFF state, battery level).

* **Control Devices:** Adjust settings for devices like smart thermostats (setting target temperatures) and smart lights (toggling power state) directly from the dashboard.

* **Register New Devices:** Easily add new smart devices to the home system, expanding the network's capabilities.

The application communicates with a dedicated backend web service to retrieve and persist device data, ensuring all controls and statuses are up-to-date and reliably stored.

## Known Issues

* **External Registration Latency:** Registering devices using external services (Apple/Google sign-in) is noticeably slower than manual registration, and the UI currently lacks a visual loading indicator, potentially confusing the user.

## Roadmap Features

We have exciting plans for future enhancements to elevate the smart home experience:

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure login, registration, and user-specific device management.

* **Third-Party API Integration:** Incorporate external services like local weather forecasts, calendar integration, or voice assistant commands.

* **Advanced Automations & Scenes:** Allow users to create custom scenes (e.g., "Goodnight" to dim lights, lock doors) and set up conditional rules.

* **Device History & Analytics:** Display usage graphs for energy consumption, temperature trends, etc.

* **Improved Device Categories:** Enhance categorization and filtering of devices.

* **Notifications:** Implement real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., door unlocked, motion detected).
